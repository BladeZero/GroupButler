#Group Butler

##Introduction

This bot has been created to help people in the administration of a Werewolf for Telegram group as the community size has put to much strain on GroupButler, which this bot is forked from.

##In few words
Group Butler is a Telegram API bot written in Lua. It has been created to help the members of a group to keep it clean and regulated, from the point of view of administrators and normal users.

This bot takes its long-polling loop and its structure from Otouto 3.1 and it's plugin-based. This makes easier to manage each function and command of the bot, and allows to split the different capabilities of it in different files for a more specific vision of what it should do.
